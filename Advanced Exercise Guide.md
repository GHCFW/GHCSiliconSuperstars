## **Exercise 1: Blink an LED using Wokwi Simulator for Raspberry Pi Pico**
Link to the exercise: 
	https://wokwi.com/projects/343013443582820946
	    
* Exercise 1: Blink LED complete functionality based on Basic Exercise

* Exercise 2: Use gpio_togl to toggle LED 

	```
	The purpose of this exercise is to acheive the same end goal of blinking the LED but by using a different hardware register
	1. Toggling using XOR : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-to-toggle-k-th-bit-of-a-number-n/
	2. Pick the hardware register for flipping the GPIO pin out : https://raspberrypi.github.io/pico-sdk-doxygen/sio_8h_source.html
	3. 

	```
* Bonus in Exercise 2: Notice how the LED toggles, find the bug and fix it here

        ```
	
	```
	
* Exercise 3: Implement an interrupt handler routine to toggle the LED by using a timer

	```

	```
